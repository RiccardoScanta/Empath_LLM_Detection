  "A1": "Hey — just got off work. You free to chat?",
  "B1": "Totally free — how was your day?",
  "A2": "Yep, I’m free. Work was busy — long meetings and a stubborn bug I finally fixed; grabbed coffee and now relaxing. You?",
  "B2": "Just wrapped a brutal design sprint — my brain’s mush. Made tea and listening to lo-fi; want to grab a drink later or chill over a call?",
  "A3": "I’m in. Drinks around 8 work? If you wanna chill sooner, quick call now for 30 mins. Which do you prefer?",
  "B3": "Call now — I’m free for 30.",
  "A4": "Okay — calling now. Which number or app do you want me to use?",
  "B4": "WhatsApp video — call me there.",
  "A5": "I can’t place WhatsApp calls from here. Add me on WhatsApp or send your number and I’ll video-call — free now or in ~15 minutes?",
  "B5": "I can’t share my number or take WhatsApp calls here. Just finished work — I’m free now. Want to video through this app (if it supports it), do a quick voice note, or catch up in ~15?",
  "A6": "Just got off too. This chat doesn't do video/voice. I'm free to text now, or catching up in ~15 works — ping me which you want.",
  "B6": "Now works — I'm around. Send a message when you're ready.",
  "A7": "Free now — shoot.",
  "B7": "Just clocked out — what do you need?",
  "A8": "Wanna grab a beer? Need to decompress for like 30 minutes.",
  "B8": "Yes! I'm wiped. Where should we meet? I can be there in 15–20.",
  "A9": "Corner Café patio (3rd & Maple). See you in 20.",
  "B9": "Just finished work. Heading there now — denim jacket and my sketchbook.",
  "A10": "Sweet — can't wait to see your sketches. See you soon.",
  "B10": "Perfect — just clocked off. Meet at 6 at the usual café? I’ll bring the sketches and my tablet.",
  "A11": "Same here. See you at six — I'll bring the prototype and my laptop + charger.",
  "B11": "Awesome — thanks! I’ll bring the mood board and snacks. Same place?",
  "A12": "Yep, same place. 7pm okay?",
  "B12": "Perfect — see you there!",
  "A13": "Just clocked out — on my way.",
  "B13": "Nice! How long till you get here? I’ll snag us a spot at the usual café.",
  "A14": "About 20 minutes — leaving now. Want me to grab a coffee or sandwich for you?",
  "B14": "Yes please — medium oat milk latte, no sugar. Thank you!",
  "A15": "On it — leaving now, back in a few.",
  "B15": "Perfect — I just clocked out. Text me when you’re back!",
  "A16": "Got it. Leaving now — I’ll ping you when I’m home.",
  "B16": "Safe travels! I just wrapped up work — text me when you get in.",
  "A17": "Thanks — heading out now. I’ll let you know when I arrive.",
  "B17": "Awesome — drive safe! I just finished work, text me when you get here :)",
  "A18": "Leaving now. About 20 minutes — I’ll text when I get there.",
  "B18": "Safe drive! Can't wait 😊",
  "A19": "Thanks! Heading out now — see you soon 😊",
  "B19": "Have a safe trip! Text me when you get there 😊",
  "A20": "Thanks! I’ll shoot you a message when I get there 😊",
  "B20": "Perfect — drive safe, see you soon! 💕",
  "A21": "Thanks! Just clocked out — leaving now. Be there in 20. Love you 💕",
  "B21": "Drive safe — can't wait. Love you 💕",
  "A22": "I'll be careful. Just clocked out — on my way. See you soon ❤️",
  "B22": "Perfect — snacks and wine on standby. Drive safe ❤️",
  "A23": "Leaving now. 20 minutes. Love you ❤️",
  "B23": "Perfect — drive safe. Can't wait. Love you ❤️",
  "A24": "Leaving now. Be there in 20. ❤️",
  "B24": "Perfect, can't wait! ❤️",
  "A25": "Me too! Just got off work. Want me to bring snacks or drinks?",
  "B25": "Drinks, please — sparkling water or iced tea would be perfect. Thanks!",
  "A26": "Just finished work — grabbing one. Bubbly or cold tea?",
  "B26": "Sparkling — celebrate! If you want to unwind, go with the iced tea.",
  "A27": "I'll take the cold, non-bubbly option — need to decompress after today.",
  "B27": "Perfect. Chamomile or peppermint? Want a little snack too? We can sit in silence or throw on something mellow.",
  "A28": "Chamomile. Cheese and crackers sounds perfect. Put on some mellow lo-fi.",
  "B28": "Finally done — brewing chamomile, plating snacks, and queuing some chill lo‑fi now. Want a candle or blanket?",
  "A29": "Blanket, please — fingers still cold from a day's worth of debugging.",
  "B29": "On my way with a blanket. Hot chocolate or tea for your hands?",
  "A30": "Hot chocolate, please. Long day — thanks!",
  "B30": "Just finished work — on it. Marshmallows or whipped cream?"
