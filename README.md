Semantic Delta: A Single Interpretable Signal Differentiating Human and LLM DialogueThis repository contains the implementation of a statistical framework designed to distinguish between human-written and Large Language Model (LLM) generated dialogue. The research introduces a lightweight, interpretable metric derived from semantic category distributions.+1🔬 Project OverviewThe core of this project is the Semantic Delta, a novel statistical feature for AI detection based on thematic concentration. While human communication is characterized by a balanced and multifaceted distribution of topics, LLMs tend to maintain a more rigid and concentrated thematic focus.+1The MetricSemantic Delta Definition: The numerical difference between the intensity scores of the two most dominant thematic categories within a text.+2Framework: Uses the Empath lexical analysis tool to map text to thematic intensity scores using word embeddings.+1Hypothesis: LLM outputs exhibit stronger thematic concentration (higher deltas) than human discourse.+2📊 Experimental ResultsSystematic analysis across large-scale samples reveals that AI-generated texts consistently produce significantly higher deltas than human texts.+1Key StatisticsGroupMean (μ)Standard Deviation (σ)Human0.0017 0.0022 AI0.0039 0.0041 Validation: A Welch's t-test yielded a p-value < 0.05, confirming the statistical significance of the divergence.+1🛠️ Technical StackLanguage: Python +2Analysis: Empath Library Models Evaluated: gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-40-mini Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn 📂 DatasetsThe study compares diverse conversational data to capture a wide spectrum of linguistic styles:Human Corpus: Modern colloquial exchange (Friends scripts), formal historical variety (William Shakespeare), and contemporary digital interaction (Reddit threads).AI Corpus: Dialogues generated via OpenAI API using varied system and user prompts.+2📜 CitationCode snippet@article{bertolotti2026semantic,
